# Hiiiiiiiiii
To Mackie, Kenneth, and Kasey, who I told that unruly customers was the biggest lie on my resume, I lied.
Web development is and this site has been giving me trouble but it has a roadmap.

## Priorities
1. Having the resume perform a wget on my resume.pdf or importing a pdf viewer library
2. Setting up the cast and crew page
3. Setting up for mobile users. This involves navbar shrinking dynamically
4. Moving off Vercel to a server I run at home and switching off the google domain for emails
5. The sliding images WILL become one constantly sliding collage that will be different on each load

## Small changes
1. Optimizing image loads
2. Switching projects to it's own page and adding a github button
3. Adding more socials to the navbar
4. I'm recording the development for maybe a tik tok


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
