### Hiiiiiiiiii
To Mackie, Kenneth, and Kasey, who I told that unruly customers was the biggest lie on my resume, I lied.
Web development is and this site has been giving me trouble but it has a roadmap.

# Priorities
1. Having the resume perform a wget on my resume.pdf or importing a pdf viewer library
2. Setting up the cast and crew page
3. Setting up for mobile users. This involves navbar shrinking dynamically
4. The sliding images WILL become one constantly sliding collage that will be different on each load

# Small changes
1. Switching projects to it's own page and adding a github button
2. Adding more socials to the navbar
3. I'm recording the development for maybe a tik tok


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
