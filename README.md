# Hi hi welcome to the website build page
### As you can see we're still in development, going to stay on Vercel until I feel the front end is satisfied because it makes testing easy

## TO DO
1. Finish 'About Me'
2. Turn 'Projects' into its own page
3. Moving off Vercel to Firebase hosting
4. The sliding images WILL become one constantly sliding collage that will be different on each load
